You may encounter editor errors due to this.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Use Godot editor version 4.4.1.stable to edit the project.
Note: the project may be using a custom version of Godot. Detection for this has not been implemented yet.
If you find that you have many non-import errors upon opening the project 
(i.e. scripts or shaders have many errors), use the original game's binary as the export template.
